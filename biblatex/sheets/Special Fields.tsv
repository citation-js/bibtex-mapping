field	fieldType	dataType	description
crossref	field	entry key	This field holds an entry key for the cross-referencing feature. Child entries with a \bibfield{crossref} field inherit data from the parent entry specified in the \bibfield{crossref} field. If the number of child entries referencing a specific parent entry hits a certain threshold, the parent entry is automatically added to the bibliography even if it has not been cited explicitly. The threshold is settable with the \opt{mincrossrefs} package option from \secref{use:opt:pre:gen}. Style authors should note that whether or not the \bibfield{crossref} fields of the child entries are defined on the \biblatex level depends on the availability of the parent entry. If the parent entry is available, the \bibfield{crossref} fields of the child entries will be defined. If not, the child entries still inherit the data from the parent entry but their \bibfield{crossref} fields will be undefined. Whether the parent entry is added to the bibliography implicitly because of the threshold or explicitly because it has been cited does not matter. See also the \bibfield{xref} field in this section as well as \secref{bib:cav:ref}.
entryset	field	separated values	This field is specific to entry sets. See \secref{use:use:set} for details. This field is consumed by the backend processing and does not appear in the \path{.bbl}.
execute	field	code	A special field which holds arbitrary \tex code to be executed whenever the data of the respective entry is accessed. This may be useful to handle special cases. Conceptually, this field is comparable to the hooks \cmd{AtEveryBibitem}, \cmd{AtEveryLositem}, and \cmd{AtEveryCitekey} from \secref{aut:fmt:hok}, except that it is definable on a per-entry basis in the \file{bib} file. Any code in this field is executed automatically immediately after these hooks.
gender	field	Pattern matching one of: \opt{sf	, \opt{sm}, \opt{sn}, \opt{pf}, \opt{pm}, \opt{pn}, \opt{pp}} The gender of the author or the gender of the editor, if there is no author. The following identifiers are supported: \opt{sf} (feminine singular, a single female name), \opt{sm} (masculine singular, a single male name), \opt{sn} (neuter singular, a single neuter name), \opt{pf} (feminine plural, a list of female names), \opt{pm} (masculine plural, a list of male names), \opt{pn} (neuter plural, a list of neuter names), \opt{pp} (plural, a mixed gender list of names). This information is only required by special bibliography and citation styles and only in certain languages. For example, a citation style may replace recurrent author names with a term such as <idem>. If the Latin word is used, as is custom in English and French, there is no need to specify the gender. In German publications, however, such key terms are usually given in German and in this case they are gender-sensitive.
langid	field	identifier	The language id of the bibliography entry. The alias \bibfield{hyphenation} is provided for backwards compatibility. The identifier must be a language name known to the \sty{babel}/\sty{polyglossia} packages. This information may be used to switch hyphenation patterns and localise strings in the bibliography. Note that the language names are case sensitive. The languages currently supported by this package are given in \tabref{bib:fld:tab1}. Note that \sty{babel} treats the identifier \opt{english} as an alias for \opt{british} or \opt{american}, depending on the \sty{babel} version. The \biblatex package always treats it as an alias for \opt{american}. It is preferable to use the language identifiers \opt{american} and \opt{british} (\sty{babel}) or a language specific option to specify a language variant (\sty{polyglossia}, using the \bibfield{langidopts} field) to avoid any possible confusion. Compare \bibfield{language} in \secref{bib:fld:dat}.
langidopts	field	literal	For \sty{polyglossia} users, allows per-entry language specific options. The literal value of this field is passed to \sty{polyglossia}'s language switching facility when using the package option \opt{autolang=langname}. For example, the fields:
ids	field	separated list of entrykeys	Citation key aliases for the main citation key. An entry may be cited by any of its aliases and \biblatex will treat the citation as if it had used the primary citation key. This is to aid users who change their citation keys but have legacy documents which use older keys for the same entry. This field is consumed by the backend processing and does not appear in the \path{.bbl}.
indexsorttitle	field	literal	The title used when sorting the index. In contrast to \bibfield{indextitle}, this field is used for sorting only. The printed title in the index is the \bibfield{indextitle} or the \bibfield{title} field. This field may be useful if the title contains special characters or commands which interfere with the sorting of the index. Consider this example:
keywords	field	separated values	A separated list of keywords. These keywords are intended for the bibliography filters (see \secref{use:bib:bib, use:use:div}), they are usually not printed. Note that with the default separator (comma), spaces around the separator are ignored.
options	field	separated \keyval options	A separated list of entry options in \keyval notation. This field is used to set options on a per-entry basis. See \secref{use:opt:bib} for details. Note that citation and bibliography styles may define additional entry options.
presort	field	string	A special field used to modify the sorting order of the bibliography. This field is the first item the sorting routine considers when sorting the bibliography, hence it may be used to arrange the entries in groups. This may be useful when creating subdivided bibliographies with the bibliography filters. Please refer to \secref{use:srt} for further details. Also see \secref{aut:ctm:srt}. This field is consumed by the backend processing and does not appear in the \path{.bbl}.
related	field	separated values	Citation keys of other entries which have a relationship to this entry. The relationship is specified by the \bibfield{relatedtype} field. Please refer to \secref{use:rel} for further details.
relatedoptions	field	separated values	Per-type options to set for a related entry. Note that this does not set the options on the related entry itself, only the \opt{dataonly} clone which is used as a datasource for the parent entry.
relatedtype	field	identifier	An identifier which specified the type of relationship for the keys listed in the \bibfield{related} field. The identifier is a localised bibliography string printed before the data from the related entry list. It is also used to identify type-specific formatting directives and bibliography macros for the related entries. Please refer to \secref{use:rel} for further details.
relatedstring	field	literal	A field used to override the bibliography string specified by \bibfield{relatedtype}. Please refer to \secref{use:rel} for further details.
sortkey	field	literal	A field used to modify the sorting order of the bibliography. Think of this field as the master sort key. If present, \biblatex uses this field during sorting and ignores everything else, except for the \bibfield{presort} field. Please refer to \secref{use:srt} for further details. This field is consumed by the backend processing and does not appear in the \path{.bbl}.
sortname	list	name	A name or a list of names used to modify the sorting order of the bibliography. If present, this list is used instead of \bibfield{author} or \bibfield{editor} when sorting the bibliography. Please refer to \secref{use:srt} for further details. This field is consumed by the backend processing and does not appear in the \path{.bbl}.
sortshorthand	field	literal	Similar to \bibfield{sortkey} but used in the list of shorthands. If present, \biblatex uses this field instead of \bibfield{shorthand} when sorting the list of shorthands. This is useful if the \bibfield{shorthand} field holds shorthands with formatting commands such as \cmd{emph} or \cmd{textbf}. This field is consumed by the backend processing and does not appear in the \path{.bbl}.
sorttitle	field	literal	A field used to modify the sorting order of the bibliography. If present, this field is used instead of the \bibfield{title} field when sorting the bibliography. The \bibfield{sorttitle} field may come in handy if you have an entry with a title like «An Introduction to\dots» and want that alphabetized under <I> rather than <A>. In this case, you could put «Introduction to\dots» in the \bibfield{sorttitle} field. Please refer to \secref{use:srt} for further details. This field is consumed by the backend processing and does not appear in the \path{.bbl}.
sortyear	field	integer	A field used to modify the sorting order of the bibliography. In the default sorting templates, if this field is present, it is used instead of the \bibfield{year} field when sorting the bibliography. Please refer to \secref{use:srt} for further details. This field is consumed by the backend processing and does not appear in the \path{.bbl}.
xdata	field	separated list of entrykeys	This field inherits data from one or more \bibtype{xdata} entries. Conceptually, the \bibfield{xdata} field is related to \bibfield{crossref} and \bibfield{xref}: \bibfield{crossref} establishes a logical parent/child relation and inherits data; \bibfield{xref} establishes as logical parent/child relation without inheriting data; \bibfield{xdata} inherits data without establishing a relation. The value of the \bibfield{xdata} may be a single entry key or a separated list of keys. See \secref{use:use:xdat} for further details. This field is consumed by the backend processing and does not appear in the \path{.bbl}.
