afterword	list	name	The author(s) of an afterword to the work. If the author of the afterword is identical to the \bibfield{editor} and\slash or \bibfield{translator}, the standard styles will automatically concatenate these fields in the bibliography. See also \bibfield{introduction} and \bibfield{foreword}.
annotation	field	literal	This field may be useful when implementing a style for annotated bibliographies. It is not used by all standard bibliography styles. Note that this field is completely unrelated to \bibfield{annotator}. The \bibfield{annotator} is the author of annotations which are part of the work cited.
annotator	list	name	The author(s) of annotations to the work. If the annotator is identical to the \bibfield{editor} and\slash or \bibfield{translator}, the standard styles will automatically concatenate these fields in the bibliography. See also \bibfield{commentator}.

bookpagination	field	key	If the work is published as part of another one, this is the pagination scheme of the enclosing work, \ie \bibfield{bookpagination} relates to \bibfield{pagination} like \bibfield{booktitle} to \bibfield{title}. The value of this field will affect the formatting of the \bibfield{pages} and \bibfield{pagetotal} fields. The key should be given in the singular form. Possible keys are \texttt{page}, \texttt{column}, \texttt{line}, \texttt{verse}, \texttt{section}, and \texttt{paragraph}. See also \bibfield{pagination} as well as \secref{bib:use:pag}.
booksubtitle	field	literal	The subtitle related to the \bibfield{booktitle}. If the \bibfield{subtitle} field refers to a work which is part of a larger publication, a possible subtitle of the main work is given in this field. See also \bibfield{subtitle}.

chapter	field	literal	A chapter or section or any other unit of a work.
commentator	list	name	The author(s) of a commentary to the work. Note that this field is intended for commented editions which have a commentator in addition to the author. If the work is a stand-alone commentary, the commentator should be given in the \bibfield{author} field. If the commentator is identical to the \bibfield{editor} and\slash or \bibfield{translator}, the standard styles will automatically concatenate these fields in the bibliography. See also \bibfield{annotator}.
date	field	date	The publication date. See also \bibfield{month} and \bibfield{year} as well as \secref{bib:use:dat,bib:use:yearordate}.

edition	field	integer or literal	The edition of a printed publication. This must be an integer, not an ordinal. Don't say |edition={First}| or |edition={1st}| but |edition={1}|. The bibliography style converts this to a language dependent ordinal. It is also possible to give the edition as a literal string, for example «Third, revised and expanded edition».
editor	list	name	The editor(s) of the \bibfield{title}, \bibfield{booktitle}, or \bibfield{maintitle}, depending on the entry type. Use the \bibfield{editortype} field to specify the role if it is different from <\texttt{editor}>. See \secref{bib:use:edr} for further hints.

Roles supported by default are \texttt{editor}, \texttt{compiler}, \texttt{founder}, \texttt{continuator}, \texttt{redactor}, \texttt{reviser}, \texttt{collaborator}, \texttt{organizer}. The role <\texttt{editor}> is the default. In this case, the field is omissible. See \secref{bib:use:edr} for further hints.
editoratype	field	key	Similar to \bibfield{editortype} but referring to the \bibfield{editora} field. See \secref{bib:use:edr} for further hints.

editorctype	field	key	Similar to \bibfield{editortype} but referring to the \bibfield{editorc} field. See \secref{bib:use:edr} for further hints.
eid	field	literal	The electronic identifier of an \bibtype{article}. This field may replace the \bibfield{pages} field for journals deviating from the classic pagination scheme of printed journals by only enumerating articles or papers and not pages.
entrysubtype	field	literal	This field, which is not used by the standard styles, may be used to specify a subtype of an entry type. This may be useful for bibliography styles which support a finer-grained set of entry types.
eprint	field	verbatim	The electronic identifier of an online publication. This is roughly comparable to a \acr{doi} but specific to a certain archive, repository, service, or system. See \secref{use:use:epr} for details. Also see \bibfield{eprinttype} and \bibfield{eprintclass}.
eprintclass	field	literal	Additional information related to the resource indicated by the \bibfield{eprinttype} field. This could be a section of an archive, a path indicating a service, a classification of some sort, etc. See \secref{use:use:epr} for details. Also see \bibfield{eprint} and \bibfield{eprinttype}.
eprinttype	field	literal	The type of \bibfield{eprint} identifier, \eg the name of the archive, repository, service, or system the \bibfield{eprint} field refers to. See \secref{use:use:epr} for details. Also see \bibfield{eprint} and \bibfield{eprintclass}.
eventdate	field	date	The date of a conference, a symposium, or some other event in \bibtype{proceedings} and \bibtype{inproceedings} entries. This field may also be useful for the custom types listed in \secref{bib:typ:ctm}. See also \bibfield{eventtitle} and \bibfield{venue} as well as \secref{bib:use:dat}.

This field may also be useful for the custom types listed in \secref{bib:typ:ctm}. Note that this field holds the plain title of the event. Things like «Proceedings of the Fifth XYZ Conference» go into the \bibfield{titleaddon} or \bibfield{booktitleaddon} field, respectively. See also \bibfield{eventdate} and \bibfield{venue}.
eventtitleaddon	field	literal	An annex to the \bibfield{eventtitle} field. Can be used for known event acronyms, for example.
file	field	verbatim	A local link to a \acr{pdf} or other version of the work. Not used by the standard bibliography styles.

See also \bibfield{introduction} and \bibfield{afterword}.
holder	list	name	The holder(s) of a \bibtype{patent}, if different from the \bibfield{author}. Note that corporate holders need to be wrapped in an additional set of braces, see \secref{bib:use:inc} for details. This list may also be useful for the custom types listed in \secref{bib:typ:ctm}.
howpublished	field	literal	A publication notice for unusual publications which do not fit into any of the common categories.
indextitle	field	literal	A title to use for indexing instead of the regular \bibfield{title} field. This field may be useful if you have an entry with a title like «An Introduction to \dots» and want that indexed as «Introduction to \dots, An». Style authors should note that \biblatex automatically copies the value of the \bibfield{title} field to \bibfield{indextitle} if the latter field is undefined.
institution	list	literal	The name of a university or some other institution, depending on the entry type. Traditional \bibtex uses the field name \bibfield{school} for theses, which is supported as an alias. See also \secref{bib:fld:als, bib:use:and}.
introduction	list	name	The author(s) of an introduction to the work. If the author of the introduction is identical to the \bibfield{editor} and\slash or \bibfield{translator}, the standard styles will automatically concatenate these fields in the bibliography.

The placement of \bibfield{issue} is similar to \bibfield{month} and \bibfield{number}. Integer ranges and short designators are better written to the \bibfield{number} field. See also \bibfield{month}, \bibfield{number} and \secref{bib:use:iss, bib:use:issnum}.
issuesubtitle	field	literal	The subtitle of a specific issue of a journal or other periodical.

journaltitle	field	literal	The name of a journal, a newspaper, or some other periodical.
label	field	literal	A designation to be used by the citation style as a substitute for the regular label if any data required to generate the regular label is missing. For example, when an author-year citation style is generating a citation for an entry which is missing the author or the year, it may fall back to \bibfield{label}. See \secref{bib:use:key} for details. Note that, in contrast to \bibfield{shorthand}, \bibfield{label} is only used as a fallback. See also \bibfield{shorthand}.
language	list	key	The language(s) of the work. Languages may be specified literally or as localisation keys. If localisation keys are used, the prefix \texttt{lang} is omissible. See also \bibfield{origlanguage} and compare \bibfield{langid} in \secref{bib:fld:spc}.

Traditional \bibtex uses the field name \bibfield{address}, which is supported as an alias. See also \secref{bib:fld:als, bib:use:and}. With \bibtype{patent} entries, this list indicates the scope of a patent. This list may also be useful for the custom types listed in \secref{bib:typ:ctm}.
mainsubtitle	field	literal	The subtitle related to the \bibfield{maintitle}. See also \bibfield{subtitle}.
maintitle	field	literal	The main title of a multi-volume book, such as \emph{Collected Works}. If the \bibfield{title} or \bibfield{booktitle} field indicates the title of a single volume which is part of multi-volume book, the title of the complete work is given in this field.
maintitleaddon	field	literal	An annex to the \bibfield{maintitle}, to be printed in a different font.
month	field	literal	The publication month. This must be an integer, not an ordinal or a string. Don't say |month={January}| but |month={1}|. The bibliography style converts this to a language dependent string or ordinal where required. This field is a literal field only when given explicitly in the data (for plain \bibtex compatibility for example). It is however better to use the \bibfield{date} field as this supports many more features. See \secref{bib:use:dat,bib:use:yearordate}.
nameaddon	field	literal	An addon to be printed immediately after the author name in the bibliography. Not used by the standard bibliography styles. This field may be useful to add an alias or pen name (or give the real name if the pseudonym is commonly used to refer to that author).
note	field	literal	Miscellaneous bibliographic data which does not fit into any other field. The \bibfield{note} field may be used to record bibliographic data in a free format. Publication facts such as «Reprint of the edition London 1831» are typical candidates for the \bibfield{note} field. See also \bibfield{addendum}.
number	field	literal	The number of a journal or the volume\slash number of a book in a \bibfield{series}. See also \bibfield{issue} as well as \secref{bib:use:ser, bib:use:iss, bib:use:issnum}. With \bibtype{patent} entries, this is the number or record token of a patent or patent request. Normally this field will be an integer or an integer range, but it may also be a short designator that is not entirely numeric such as «S1», «Suppl.\ 2», «3es». In these cases the output should be scrutinised carefully. Since \bibfield{number} is---maybe counterintuitively given its name---a literal field, sorting templates will not treat its contents as integers, but as literal strings, which means that «11» may sort between «1» and «2». If integer sorting is desired, the field can be declared an integer field in a custom data model (see \secref{aut:ctm:dm}). But then the sorting of non-integer values is not well defined.
organization	list	literal	The organization(s) that published a \bibtype{manual} or an \bibtype{online} resource, or sponsored a conference. See also \secref{bib:use:and}.
origdate	field	date	If the work is a translation, a reprint, or something similar, the publication date of the original edition. Not used by the standard bibliography styles. See also \bibfield{date}.
origlanguage	list	key	If the work is a translation, the language(s) of the original work. See also \bibfield{language}.
origlocation	list	literal	If the work is a translation, a reprint, or something similar, the \bibfield{location} of the original edition. Not used by the standard bibliography styles. See also \bibfield{location} and \secref{bib:use:and}.
origpublisher	list	literal	If the work is a translation, a reprint, or something similar, the \bibfield{publisher} of the original edition. Not used by the standard bibliography styles. See also \bibfield{publisher} and \secref{bib:use:and}.
origtitle	field	literal	If the work is a translation, the \bibfield{title} of the original work. Not used by the standard bibliography styles. See also \bibfield{title}.
pages	field	range	One or more page numbers or page ranges. If the work is published as part of another one, such as an article in a journal or a collection, this field holds the relevant page range in that other work. It may also be used to limit the reference to a specific part of a work (a chapter in a book, for example). For papers in electronic journals with a non-classical pagination setup the \bibfield{eid} field may be more suitable.
pagetotal	field	literal	The total number of pages of the work.
pagination	field	key	The pagination of the work. The value of this field will affect the formatting the \prm{postnote} argument to a citation command. The key should be given in the singular form. Possible keys are \texttt{page}, \texttt{column}, \texttt{line}, \texttt{verse}, \texttt{section}, and \texttt{paragraph}. See also \bibfield{bookpagination} as well as \secref{bib:use:pag, use:cav:pag}.
part	field	literal	The number of a partial volume. This field applies to books only, not to journals. It may be used when a logical volume consists of two or more physical ones. In this case the number of the logical volume goes in the \bibfield{volume} field and the number of the part of that volume in the \bibfield{part} field. See also \bibfield{volume}.
publisher	list	literal	The name(s) of the publisher(s). See also \secref{bib:use:and}.

The number or volume of a book in a series is given in the \bibfield{number} field. Note that the \bibtype{article} entry type makes use of the \bibfield{series} field as well, but handles it in a special way. See \secref{bib:use:ser} for details.
shortauthor	list	name\LFMark	The author(s) of the work, given in an abbreviated form. This field is mainly intended for abbreviated forms of corporate authors, see \secref{bib:use:inc} for details.
shorteditor	list	name\LFMark	The editor(s) of the work, given in an abbreviated form. This field is mainly intended for abbreviated forms of corporate editors, see \secref{bib:use:inc} for details.
shorthand	field	literal\LFMark	A special designation to be used by the citation style instead of the usual label. If defined, it overrides the default label. See also \bibfield{label}.
shorthandintro	field	literal	The verbose citation styles which comes with this package use a phrase like «henceforth cited as [shorthand]» to introduce shorthands on the first citation. If the \bibfield{shorthandintro} field is defined, it overrides the standard phrase. Note that the alternative phrase must include the shorthand.
shortjournal	field	literal\LFMark	A short version or an acronym of the \bibfield{journaltitle}. Not used by the standard bibliography styles.
shortseries	field	literal\LFMark	A short version or an acronym of the \bibfield{series} field. Not used by the standard bibliography styles.

subtitle	field	literal	The subtitle of the work.
title	field	literal	The title of the work.
titleaddon	field	literal	An annex to the \bibfield{title}, to be printed in a different font.
translator	list	name	The translator(s) of the \bibfield{title} or \bibfield{booktitle}, depending on the entry type. If the translator is identical to the \bibfield{editor}, the standard styles will automatically concatenate these fields in the bibliography.
type	field	key	The type of a \bibfield{manual}, \bibfield{patent}, \bibfield{report}, or \bibfield{thesis}. This field may also be useful for the custom types listed in \secref{bib:typ:ctm}.
url	field	uri	The \acr{URL} of an online publication. If it is not URL-escaped (no <\%> chars) it will be URI-escaped according to RFC 3987, that is, even Unicode chars will be correctly escaped.
urldate	field	date	The access date of the address specified in the \bibfield{url} field. See also \secref{bib:use:dat}.
venue	field	literal	The location of a conference, a symposium, or some other event in \bibtype{proceedings} and \bibtype{inproceedings} entries. This field may also be useful for the custom types listed in \secref{bib:typ:ctm}. Note that the \bibfield{location} list holds the place of publication. It therefore corresponds to the \bibfield{publisher} and \bibfield{institution} lists. The location of the event is given in the \bibfield{venue} field. See also \bibfield{eventdate} and \bibfield{eventtitle}.
version	field	literal	The revision number of a piece of software, a manual, etc.
volume	field	integer	The volume of a multi-volume book or a periodical. It is expected to be an integer, not necessarily in arabic numerals since \biber will automatically from roman numerals or arabic letter to integers internally for sorting purposes. See also \bibfield{part}. See the \opt{noroman} option which can be used to suppress roman numeral parsing. This can help in cases where there is an ambiguity between parsing as roman numerals or alphanumeric (e.g. <C>), see \secref{use:opt:pre:int}.
volumes	field	integer	The total number of volumes of a multi-volume work. Depending on the entry type, this field refers to \bibfield{title} or \bibfield{maintitle}. It is expected to be an integer, not necessarily in arabic numerals since \biber will automatically from roman numerals or arabic letter to integers internally for sorting purposes. See the \opt{noroman} option which can be used to suppress roman numeral parsing. This can help in cases where there is an ambiguity between parsing as roman numerals or alphanumeric (e.g. <C>), see \secref{use:opt:pre:int}.
