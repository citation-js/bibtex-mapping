field	description
address	Usually the address of the \hbox{\tt publisher} or other type of institution. For major publishing houses, van~Leunen recommends omitting the information entirely. For small publishers, on the other hand, you can help the reader by giving the complete address.
annote	An annotation. It is not used by the standard bibliography styles, but may be used by others that produce an annotated bibliography.
author	The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the \LaTeX\ book.
booktitle	Title of a book, part of which is being cited. See the \LaTeX\ book for how to type titles. For book entries, use the \hbox{\tt title} field instead.
chapter	A chapter (or section or whatever) number.
crossref	The database key of the entry being cross referenced.
edition	The edition of a book---for example, ``Second''$\!$. This should be an ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as shown here; the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.
editor	Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the \LaTeX\ book. If there is also an \hbox{\tt author} field, then the \hbox{\tt editor} field gives the editor of the book or collection in which the reference appears.
howpublished	How something strange has been published. The first word should be capitalized.
institution	The sponsoring institution of a technical report.
journal	A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many journals; see the {\it Local Guide}.
key	Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label when the ``author'' information (described in Section~\ref{odds-and-ends}) is missing. This field should not be confused with the key that appears in the \hbox{\verb|\cite|} command and at the beginning of the database entry.
month	The month in which the work was published or, for an unpublished work, in which it was written. You should use the standard three-letter abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3 of the \LaTeX\ book.
note	Any additional information that can help the reader. The first word should be capitalized.
number	The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a work in a series. An issue of a journal or magazine is usually identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues a technical report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are given numbers in a named series.
organization	The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes a \hbox{manual}.
pages	One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as \hbox{\tt 42--111} or \hbox{\tt 7,41,73--97} or \hbox{\tt 43+} (the `{\tt +}' in this last example indicates pages following that don't form a simple range). To make it easier to maintain {\em Scribe\/}-compatible databases, the standard styles convert a single dash (as in \hbox{\tt 7-33}) to the double dash used in \TeX\ to denote number ranges (as in \hbox{\tt 7--33}).
publisher	The publisher's name.
school	The name of the school where a thesis was written.
series	The name of a series or set of books. When citing an entire book, the the \hbox{\tt title} field gives its title and an optional \hbox{\tt series} field gives the name of a series or multi-volume set in which the book is published.
title	The work's title, typed as explained in the \LaTeX\ book.
type	The type of a technical report---for example, ``Research Note''$\!$.
volume	The volume of a journal or multivolume book.
